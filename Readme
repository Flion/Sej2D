Just a note about the missing license for this project.  This is intended as an example for teaching Unity mechanics.
As such, you are free to use and modify code from this project in part but not in full.  The rules for this game are 
copyright 1980 to author C. J. Cherryh, so the actual game may not be sold without permission from her.  It's simple:
using the mechanics in your own original game is fair use of my software.  Creating a Sej game using her rules is a 
violation of her copyright unless you have received permission. Please use this only as the example it was intended
to be.
